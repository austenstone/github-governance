# Migrate

You can migrate to GitHub Enterprise Cloud using the [GitHub Enterprise Importer](https://docs.github.com/en/early-access/enterprise-importer).
* Migrate between GitHub products
* Migrate from Azure DevOps
* COMING SOON - Migrate from other SCM sources

Our legacy tool [Enterprise Cloud Importer](https://github.github.com/enterprise-migrations/#/) handles other souces such as [GitLab](https://github.github.com/enterprise-migrations/#/./2.2.2-export-from-gitlab), [BitBucket](https://github.github.com/enterprise-migrations/#/./2.2.3-export-from-bitbucket), and [others](https://github.github.com/enterprise-migrations/#/./2.2.4-export-from-other).

# Secure

Authenticate with [SAML single sign-on](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/authentication/authenticating-with-saml-single-sign-on) to secure your GitHub enterprise.

Manage user access from your IDP via [SCIM](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/organizations/managing-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-organization/about-scim-for-organizations) and [Team Sync](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/organizations/managing-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-organization/managing-team-synchronization-for-your-organization).

Use [GitHub Advanced Security](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security) to secure your supply chain and source code.
* Code Scanning
* Secret Scanning
* Dependency review

[Secure your CI/CD pipeline](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions).
